I developed a CNN-LSTM based machine learning model for malware detection. Our model demonstrated a high precision of 0.99 in correctly identifying benign files and an impressive
recall of 0.99 for detecting malware, indicating its strong capability to identify malware instances reliably, though the precision for malware detection at 0.76 shows
a need to reduce false positives.

The robustness of our project stems from the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This combination allows our system 
to efficiently extract features and recognize temporal patterns in data, enhancing its detection capabilities. Having successfully deployed this model with a user-friendly 
front-end interface, we are now focusing on further enhancements, such as incorporating dynamic analysis and employing larger, real-time datasets to increase the modelâ€™s
applicability in real-world scenarios.
